# New_Employee_Salary_Prediction

-> Finding the correct pay for new employees can depend on major factors such has experience, skillset, tech stack, referals and what not, that's why
as a Machine Learning Engineer you are required to develop a model, which based on available position as well as candidates information can give a rough estimate
about the salary range.

-> Always have some standard deviation in these kind of predictive analysis, who know's someone like me can still be Underpaid.
